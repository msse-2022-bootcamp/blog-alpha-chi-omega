# Introduction for Charis Liao

Charis was born in Taiwan and immigrated to the United States at a young age. She lived in Los Angeles for several years and moved to Berkeley for her undergraduate studies. After she graduated from college, she moved back to Southern California to continue her master education in the Molecular Science and Software Engineering program at Berkeley. She currently resides in Chino, California. 

Charis is a foodie. She LOVES a variety of food, and due to her background and the environment where she grew up, she was exposed to many cultures and food including Thai, Mexican, American, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, Chinese etc. She enjoys all kinds of food, but her favorite is a Korean dish, Galbijjim. It is a Korean steamed dish made with short ribs. 

Charis and I actually have several things in common, actually. We both were not born in the U.S., and we both have a science undergraduate background in which Charis has a degree in Molecular and Cell Biology, and I have a background in chemistry. Furthermore, weâ€™re both from Asia which I thought was very interesting. 

There are several reasons why Charis chose to study MSSE. Charis has a background in Data Science and Molecular and Cell Biology, but she never had a chance to deepen her knowledge in the common ground between the two fields. She wishes to gain more experience on working on software but applying on science. Her ultimate goal is to become a software engineer who could work on health-related applications to help improve health disparities within the minority groups in the United States and to become a proud Woman in STEM.
