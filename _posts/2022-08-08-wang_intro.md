title: Introducting Our One and Only Wang in MSSE
author: Austin Tran
---

Wang is originally from Soochow, China. It’s a beautiful city with more than 2000 years of history. But Wang’s been studying and working abroad more than half of his life. Due to Covid, he’s not traveled back to Soochow for more than 5 years. He knew barely a thing about his own hometown now.
 
Wang lives in Sunnyvale, CA. It’s a small townhouse around 1 mile away from Apple’s grand “home button”, even though Apple has removed the “home button” from their products, they left one for California. The reason for Wang and family to stay in this insanely overpriced place is that Wang used to work for Apple and wanted to stay close to the campus so that he could sleep a bit more. Now they’re considering relocating to a different place.
 
Wang’s favorite food is Chinese food. He has a dream to travel all around China and eat all the famous cuisines. If you have to name one food that he can eat every single day, it’s the noodle cooked by his wife. Wang’s least favorite food is Italian food. He used to travel to Genoa from Singapore for a conference, and stayed in Zurich, Rome, Milan and Genoa for 11 days. That was the longest time in his life without any Asian cuisine. Every day he ate cheese, cheese, cheese, and he smelled like a cow when returning to Singapore.
 
We are all from STEM and we might be “dull” to certain people. We are all Asian, so likely we share a lot of cultural background.
 
Wang chose the MSSE program in the hope to build an artificial human being with all necessary biological reflections. He is not crazy to build a human being as is, but to start from simple organisms like a mitochondria or an intestinal single cell bacteria.  He’s not considering adding any emotional aspect to the artificial human. That is certainly beyond the scope of pure chemistry or biology.
