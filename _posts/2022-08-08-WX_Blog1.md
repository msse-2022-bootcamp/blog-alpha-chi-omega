The main topics of today's lecture are:
1. Introduction to Monte Carlo methods.
    Monte Carlo methods calculate values through random sampling.
    Implementation is:
    a. with y = f(x), to estimate Area = Integer of f(x)dx;
    b. Generate a set of uniformly distributed points;
    c. Count the points below the curve;
    d. Area ~ Number of points below the curve / Total number of points generated;
    The more points generated, the more accurate the results

2. Implementation of Monte Carlo method to calculate pi
    Procedure as follows:
    a. Start with counts inside the circle to be 0: i.e. count = 0;
    b. Generate a random point;
    c. Determine is the random point lies in the unit circle, by calculating the distance of the point to the origin point;
    d. if the point is inside the circle, count += 1;
    e. Repeat steps b-d for as many times as possible;
    f. Calculate the ratio of points inside the circle / total points;

3. Special command line: jupyter notebook --no-browser

4. Python codes:
    random.random(): returns float [0.0, 1.0)
    random.uniform(a,b): returns float a <= N <= b

5. Learned about Lennard-Jones potential and its reduced form of calculation.
    a. Introduced the concept on Monte Carlo simulation of LJ potential of a molecular system;
    b. Implemented Jupyter Notebook to calculate particle distance and estimate LJ potential:

# Cutoffs
Consider a system of 10 particles. How many pairwise particle-particle interactions will there be? What about 100 or 1000 particles? Consider a system with a density of 1. Using this density, how many particles are in a sphere with radius 1, 2, 5, and 10 units? (These are math problems, you donâ€™t have to use programming to solve them, but you can.)
    The general format of pairwise particle interactions for n particles is:
    n * (n-1) / 2
    For 10 particles: 45 interactions.
    For 100 particles: 4950 interactions.
    For 1000 particles: 499500 interactions.

    The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 * pi * (r ** 3).
    With unit density of 1, the number of particles within the sphere volume is [4/3 * pi * (r ** 3) // 1]

Can you think of the benefits associated with using a cut-off? What are the risks?
    The benefits are: Reduce the cost of computation. Save time of effort.
    The risks are: The method is less accurate. It might affect the final result.

# Periodic Boundaries
Consider the following questions:

What is the maximum distance any particle can be from another in each dimension? (this will have to do with the box length)
    Given periodic boundary, and assume that all boxes are identical and are smallest repeating units, the max distance in each dimension is (Box-length / 2)
What is the actual distance of our example? ((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 8))
    Given a Box-length of 10, the actual distance between the two particles is (Box-length - 8) = 2.
