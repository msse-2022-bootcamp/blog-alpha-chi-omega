# The Backbone!   
In biology, if there were no cells, there would be no tissues nor organs. In chemistry, if there were no atoms, there would be no molecules. In computer languages, if there were no C++, there would not be python. Many building blocks of computer languages and packages are written in C++. As a compiled, statically typed language, C++ has lots of features and comparatively difficult syntax, so it could be hard to code. However, it is also really robust and efficient. Therefore, it can be used in complex programming systems that requires time efficiency.   

# C++ V.S. Python   
Different complexity of projects could be coded in different languages. As a human-user friendly, high-level language, python could be used for simple data analysis or machine learning as it has many packages premade and is simple and straightforward to use. However, when it comes to a complex system such as analyzing quantum mechanics or systems that require robust number crunching techniques, C++ would be the go-to for programming.   

# A Creative Project Example That Would Require BOTH C++ and Python   
As a person who has entered the stock market to trade since 18 years old, it would be fantastic if I could create a robust algorithm that aids my decision making when it comes to purchasing or selling stocks. Trading short term is all about time! The sooner you make correct decisions, the better chance you will be in a good standing in terms of purchasing or selling price. However, to analyze and predict the stock market requires complex analysis of current events and the history of price drops. If we could build a complex analyzing system using C++ to decrease the time required for estimations, we could be in a better shape. However, since python is more straightforward and user friendly, the interface for calling the functions for these analyses should be written in python.   

# Why Monte Carlo?
Coming back to previous topics of estimating pi using different methods (Monte Carlo and Riemann Sum), it was found that Riemann Sum requires less data points than Monte Carlo. If Riemann Sum is a better way in estimating areas under the curve, why should we bother to try Monte Carlo? 

Well, in my opinion, the question can be answered with the complexity of the curve and the area we are estimating. Monte Carlo is simple and flexible because it does not have a specific shape. However, in the Riemann Sum method, we are using histograms to estimate the area. Therefore, it does not have much flexibility.
