author: Charis Liao

Austin was born in Louisiana at one year old but moved to Orange County, California in the city of Yorba Linda. His family moved around a lot within Southern California but generally stayed within Orange County. After going out to school in Oklahoma for college, he came back home and now resides in Irvine, CA which is also in Orange County.   


Austin loves all types of food and his go to is usually Asian food as Irvine is known for its great Chinese and Taiwanese food.  Austin’s favorite food is anything mango flavored from mango flavored Hi Chews, mangonadas, to mango sticky rice. In general, he likes all types of fruits. Austin isn’t really picky with what he eats but if he had to pick, his least favorite food is anything resembling or with the texture of pudding.   


We all have undergraduate degrees in the sciences, specifically Biology (Austin and Charis) and Chemistry (Wang). We also are all living in California with Charis also living in Southern California.   


Austin chose the MSSE program to learn about programming and machine learning and how it applies to bioinformatics and genetic sequencing, specifically in patient diagnosis testing. He hopes that this program will allow him to gain exposure and insight into the biotechnology industry and work and connect with those like-minded and knowledgeable in the field. The ability to be able to work full time and take classes part time also played a big part in choosing this program. He wants to work on creating visualization tools and software for research scientists that makes sequencing data easily accessible and readable to other scientists and common users.
