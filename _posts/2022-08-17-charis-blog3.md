# Ron and Hermione    
Ron and Hermione are friends, and Ron probably will not survive if there isn't Hermione helping him in the Harry Potter movie. I would like to think of python as Ron and C++ as Hermione. At the Ron level, everything seems to be simpler. From calling the function, to reading the syntax and code, everything seems to be easier to understand comparing to C++. Furthermore, just like Hermione helping Ron, C++ is "helping" python in a way such that some python packages are written in C++ and they compliment each other very well.   

# How Hermione (C++) Operates   
Hermione is a very detail-oriented girl. She always does things carefully and always ensures that nothing goes wrong just like C++. In C++, there are many minor details that goes into passing in arguments to functions. By carefully determining how arguments should be passed in, memory space or data could be saved. Arguments could be passed in by copy, by reference, or by pointer. Passing in arguments by pointer might be the most dynamically memory friendly. If functions do not modify the arguments, then in plain data type or small data structures, arguments should be passed by copies. Whereas in large data structures, arguments should be passed by constant reference. If functions modify arguments, then generally, use a non-const reference to pass in the arguments.   

Furthermore, functions can be called the same name in C++ as long as the function signatures are different. Just like python, C++ functions can also return multiple outputs by including the utility package and calling functions such as `std::pair` or `std::make_pair`.   

Mastering C++ could be quite a challenge just like mastering spells in the wizard world is hard. However, everything takes practice and time. One day I hope to become a C++ wizard!
