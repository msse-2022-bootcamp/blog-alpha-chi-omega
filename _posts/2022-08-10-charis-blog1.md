# A Road Map to Measuring 
There are different levels of measurement in Science. From macro level to micro level and even molecular level. In general physics classes, students usually measure different forces by throwing a ball and measuring the distance. However, it will be extremely difficult to use the same kind of measuring method in the molecular level. Therefore, we have to rely on molecular stimulations to calculate the statistical mechanics of the systems. 




# Monte Carlo & Lennard-Jones Potential 

Lennard-Jones Potential is a fantastic example of needing molecular stimulations to calculate the potential energy between two particles. One of the methods that has been widly used in computational science is the Monte Carlo method. It could be used to evaluate integrals (or evaluate an area under the curve). To apply the method on a statistical mechanics model: 

⟨Q⟩ = $\int_v$ Q($r^N$) $\rho$($r^N$)$dr^N$  

Q = the thermodynamic quantity of interest (system potential energy)
$\rho$($r^N$) = probability density  
V = volume of configuration space
