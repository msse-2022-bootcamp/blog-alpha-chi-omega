# Hello, R2-D2

"May Day! May Day! Darth Vader strikes! His death star will shoot death rays at us in no time!"
"Oh, R2-D2 has the key to millenium falcon! Let's ask him to open the door of the star ship!"
"Hey R2-D2! Hurry up! The lineage of royal family lies in your hand!"

`import R2-D2`

"Open the door please!"

`name error! 'Open the door' is not defined`

"Oh my! what should we do now? what does it mean not defined?"
"Maybe it's written in Python? Let's try it again!"

`import R2-D2.open_the_door`

"No error? Now what?"
"OK I see. R2-D2 is the package. open_the_door.py is the module. We still need to call the function!"

`R2-D2.open_the_door.open_the_door_for_her_majesty_and_escape_with_star_ship`

"It's working! RD-D2 is opening the door!

Boom~~~!!! Too late...

# What about the introduction?

For a book there is a preface. For an article there is introduction. For a software package there is `__init__.py`.
As total amateurs, we would ideally want the module to perform the following functions:
1. Give a succint but reasonable introduction to the package. "Imported Monte Carlo!" is what we have now. It's pretty clear, but could be even more illustrative. We might as well go with a sentence that explains the purpose of the function, like "Imported Monte Carlo for Lennard Jones (LJ) Simulation!".
2. Import all the necessary modules and provide a little hint, if possible. Ultimately we need to be user friendly when developing a software. It's important to not let the users guess what's inside the package like peeking into a black box. But also, if we load too many modules the users might have another level of bad experience -- slow motion.
3. In the case of MC package, simply `import mcsim.monte_carlo` might just be fine if no further functions are added. We have a list of functions, ranging from `calculate distance r_ij`, to `calculate pairwise LJ energy`, to ultimately `calculate the total energy` and average with `simulation of a particle system`. It's a relatively straightforward and linear architecture, especially for users with correcponding background. However we do notice that this one module contains two types of functions: the `simulation of a particle system` function that will directly face the end users, and the underlying supporting functions, e.g. `calculate_LJ` & `calculate_distance` that supports `simulation of a particle system`. It will save more space and cleans up the module if we can separate the two types of functions to two different modules.
4. As such, when importing mcsim, we really only import the end user facing module and we can certainly replenish it with illustrations, input-taking functions and other useful features. The underlying module cross talks with the user facing module, in a "dotted manner".
5. Hence in the `__init__.py`, we would provide the following items:
        import `end user facing module`
        print("Welcome to the world of Lennard Jones built with Monte Carlo!")
        print("We will need the following parameters to simulate a particle system:")
        print("coordinates")
        coordinates = input()
        ......

# Further expanding the package

With the backbone established, we can start building a tree-like architecture. If we add numpy calculation of LJ potential into the package, the first thing is to make sure it doesn't contaminate the existing modules. We certainly notice there are common functions between the Python Standard Library (PSL) and numpy version of LJ calculation. It's unecessary to duplicate functions in common sense. One might consider moving the common functions out to a module that both the Python Standard Library (PSL) and numpy modules can refer to when needed. Such functions include:
`calculate_tail_correction`
`accept_or_reject`
It also enables the package to be separatable so that parallel development is possible.

To this end, we now have at least four modules within the package:
1. An end user facing module that is imported when the package is imported. Ideally it should contain welcome messages, illustrations, input-taking functions. It's especially useful for users with only desire to run simulation.
2. A module containing common functions: `calculate_tail_correction`, `accept_or_reject`.
3. A module for PSL specific functions: `calculate_distance`, `calculate_LJ`, `calculate_total_energy`, `calculate_pair_energy`, `run_simulation_psl_helper`
4. A module for numpy specific functions: `calculate_distance_np`, `calculate_total_energy_np`, `calculate_pair_energy_np`, `run_simulation_np_helper`.

Such an architecture ensures the cleanest structure and best efficiency in implementation and development. Although someone might think PSL runs slower than numpy, the magnitude of difference is not substantial :).

# Hello, R2-D2, again

"May Day! May Day! Darth Vader strikes, again! His death star will shoot death rays at us in no time!"
"Wait, how did you escape last time?"
"Not important!"
"Oh, R2-D2 has the key to millenium falcon! Let's ask him to open the door of the star ship!"
"Hey R2-D2! Hurry up! The lineage of royal family lies in your hand!"

`import R2-D2`
"Dear Princess Leia, it's such a wonderful day to meet you! Now my package has been re-designed with proper Python architecture. It has five modules. 1. Open the door of star ship. 2. Kick some ass. 3. Pilot the star ship. 4. Sing a song. 5. Hack the death star. Please just press the corresponding number. Have a nice day!"
"Press 1!"
"No, press 2!"
"No, I want to hear a song!"
"Press 5!"

Boom~~~!!! Too late...
